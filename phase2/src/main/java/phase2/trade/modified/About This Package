The classes in this package allow a TableView's column to be editable as a JFXComboBox.

The reason why we had to modify them (from the JavaFX) was because the original classes hide the
instantiation of the ComboBox and there is
no way to replace the ComboBox using the JFXComboBox from JFoenix library.

It only affects the view appearance, and I'm not very sure if this causes any licensing problems.
But "CellUtils" and "JFXComboBoxTableCell" are not our contribution.

It doesn't seem to be possible to extend ComboBoxTableCell since that class has private members which will be required in the child class.
Thus the only way is to extend TableCell and write our own implementation.
But it's still not worth spending time on this since I only want to replace the instantiation of that particular ComboBox
